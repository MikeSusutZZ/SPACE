## Supply, Prosper, And Conquer Everything

*After untold years, our seed ship has finally located us a home and ended our cryostasis. This new galaxy is full of possibility, resources and dangers, and all of it is yours to conquer*

This is a text based board game that places you at the head of a fledgling colony in a galaxy full of planets with resources that will help you expand further into the galaxy. The goal is to have settlements or cities on every planet in the galaxy in as few turns as possible. This game was inspired by the thought of "What if Catan made you move resources from their sources to the location you are building, rather than putting them in your hand?", followed by failed prototypes that resulted in too much info in too small of physical space. Additionally, it came from trying to play 4X space games and getting fed up with the insanely high learning curve and the sheer amount of information being thrown at you.

## How it works

The galaxy is a 15x15 board with each spot consisting of either a planet, an asteriod field, or simply empty space. The board is entirely random, so it may be possible for a galaxy to be created that is not possible to finish.

### Planets, Resources, and Building
Planets produce any number of the 5 resources: Consumables (C), Metals (M), Fuel (F), Krystals (K), and Discovery (D).
These resources can be harvested by activating a settlement or city you have built there. 
** - Consumables (C):** Used to activate settlements and cities to harvest resrources
** - Metals (M):** Used to build new things
** - Fuel (F):** Used to move ships 1 space in a turn
** - Krystals (K):** Used to build more advanced things, power warp gates, and make ships travel 2 spaces in a turn
** - Discovery (D):** spent to develop the tech tree

### Pieces
Ships can hold resources in their cargo. This cargo size is different for each ship. Ships have certain actions. All ships have: 
- Load/Unload: add resources from where they are landed to thier cargo add resources from their cargo to where they are landed
- Move: Spend one fuel from it's cargo to move one space cardinally
- Jump: Spend one krystal from it's cargo to move 2 spaces cardinally. These moves are in the same direction.

Fighters, Dreadnaughts and Turrets may:
- Attack: Destroy this to destroy a chosen opposing ship, turret, or shield. If a ships has a shield, it must be destroyed first, then turrets, then the ship itself.

Carriers and Dreadnaughts have a docking bay with different sizes where smaller ships may land, and mounting points where shields and turrets can be added. They may:
- Dock: Land ships, shields, warp rings or turrets on the same space on this ship (cannot land other carriers or dreadnaughts, docked shields and turrets cannot be used, only transported)
- Deploy: Return the landed ships, shields, and turrets to the board.

Carriers, Dreadnaughts, and Advanced fighters have a certain amount of mounting points and may:
- Mount: Add one shield, turret, or warp ring from the same space as this ship to a mounting point (Once something is mounted it may not be removed)

Warp Gates may:
- Mass Warp: Move any number of ships to the location of any other warp gate

Warp Rings may:
- Individual Warp: Move the ship this is mounted to to the location of any warp gate
